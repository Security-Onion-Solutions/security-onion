#summary Some notes about Ubuntu's UFW firewall

= UFW Documentation=

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW

= Xplico =
Xplico runs on port 9876, which is not open to the outside world by default.

= Open a port =
Suppose you want to open port 9876 for Xplico:

{{{
sudo ufw allow 9876/tcp
}}}

= UFW - Uncomplicated Firewall=
The default firewall configuration tool for Ubuntu is ufw. Developed to ease iptables firewall configuration, ufw provides a user friendly way to create an IPv4 or IPv6 host-based firewall. By default UFW is enabled on security onion.

Note: Gufw is a GUI front end for the ufw.

==Enable and Disable=
*example:* to turn ufw on:
{{{
sudo ufw enable
}}}
*example:* to turn ufw off:
{{{
sudo ufw disable
}}}
==Allow and Deny=

===Allow=

*example:* to allow incoming tcp and udp packet port 53
{{{
sudo ufw allow 53
}}}
*example:* to allow incoming tcp packets on port 53
{{{
sudo ufw allow 53/tcp
}}}
*example:* to allow incoming up packets on port 53
{{{
sudo ufw allow 53/udp
}}}

===Deny=
*example:* To deny tcp and udp packets on port 53
{{{

*example:* To deny incoming tcp packets on port 53
{{{
sudo ufw deny 53/tcp
