#summary Some notes about Ubuntu's UFW firewall

= UFW - Uncomplicated Firewall=
The default firewall configuration tool for Ubuntu is ufw. Developed to ease iptables firewall configuration, ufw provides a user friendly way to create an IPv4 or IPv6 host-based firewall. By default UFW is enabled on security onion.

Note: Gufw is a GUI front end for the ufw.

==Enable and Disable=
*example:* to turn ufw on:
{{{
sudo ufw enable
}}}
*example:* to turn ufw off:
{{{
sudo ufw disable
}}}
==Allow and Deny=

===Allow=

*example:* to allow incoming tcp and udp packet port 53
{{{
sudo ufw allow 53
}}}
*example:* to allow incoming tcp packets on port 53
{{{
sudo ufw allow 53/tcp
}}}
*example:* to allow incoming up packets on port 53
{{{
sudo ufw allow 53/udp
}}}

===Deny=
*example:* To deny tcp and udp packets on port 53
{{{
sudo ufw deny 53
}}}
*example:* To deny incoming tcp packets on port 53
{{{
sudo ufw deny 53/tcp
}}}
*example:* To deny incoming udp packets on port 53
{{{
sudo ufw deny 53/udp
}}}
==Delete Existing Rule=
To delete a rule, simply prefix the original rule with delete.
{{{
ufw deny 80/tcp
}}}

Use this to delete it:
{{{
sudo ufw delete deny 80/tcp
}}}
==Services=
You can also allow or deny by service name since ufw reads from /etc/services. To see get a list of services:
{{{
less /etc/services
}}}
==Allow by Service Name=
*example:* to allow ssh by name
{{{
sudo ufw allow ssh
}}}
==Deny by Service Name=
*example:* to deny ssh by name
{{{
sudo ufw deny ssh
}}}

==Status=
Checking the status of ufw will tell you if ufw is enabled or disabled and also list the current ufw rules that are applied to your iptables.

To check the status of ufw.
{{{
sudo ufw status
