#summary BPF support in Security Onion

= Configuration =

== Global bpf.conf ==
In Security Onion 12.04, you can specify your BPF in one location (/etc/nsm/rules/bpf.conf).  Bro automatically monitors this file for changes and will update as needed.  Other services (such as Snort/Suricata, prads, and netsniff-ng) will need to be restarted for the change to take effect.

== Granular bpf.conf ==
Each process on each interface has its own bpf file, but by default the per-process bpf files are symlinked to the interface bpf and the interface bpf is symlinked to the global bpf.conf:
{{{
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root  root     8 Jan 13 21:47 bpf-bro.conf -> bpf.conf
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root  root    23 Jan 13 21:47 bpf.conf -> /etc/nsm/rules/bpf.conf
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root  root     8 Jan 13 21:47 bpf-ids.conf -> bpf.conf
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root  root     8 Jan 13 21:47 bpf-pcap.conf -> bpf.conf
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root  root     8 Jan 13 21:47 bpf-prads.conf -> bpf.conf
}}}

If you need to specify a bpf per-interface or per-process, you can simply replace the default symlink(s) with the desired bpf file(s) and restart service(s) as necessary.

= BPF Examples =

From Phillip Wang:

Just to contribute, and for others to reference, here are some examples of what I've got working

{{{
#Nothing from src host to dst port
!(src host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx && dst port 161) &&

#Nothing from src host to dst host and dst port
!(src host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx && dst host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx && dst port 80) &&

#Nothing to or from:
!(host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) &&

#Last entry has no final &&
!(host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
}}}

From Seth Hall regarding VLAN tags:

{{{
(not (host 192.168.53.254 or host 192.168.53.60 or host 192.168.53.69 or host 192.168.53.234)) or (vlan and (not (host 192.168.53.254 or host 192.168.53.60 or host 192.168.53.69 or host 192.168.53.234)))
}}}

This amazingly works if you are only using it to restrict the traffic passing through the filter.  The basic template isâ€¦

{{{
<your filter> and (vlan and <your filter>)
}}}

Once the "vlan" tag is included in the filter, all subsequent expressions to the right are shifted by four bytes so you need to duplicate the filter on both sides of the vlan keyword.  There are edge cases where this will no longer work and probably edge cases where a few undesired packets will make it though, but it should work in the example case that you've given.

Also, I'm assuming that any tools you are running will support vlan tags and no tags simultaneously.  Bro 2.0 should work fine at least.
