#summary Spinning up multiple instances of Snort/Suricata and Bro using PF_RING

= Setup =

Setup will automatically ask you how many instances you'd like (assuming
you choose Advanced Setup and you have multiple cores) and will tell you
how to adjust after the fact.

= Tuning =

If you want to change it after running Setup, you can do something like:
  * Stop sensor processes:
{{{
sudo nsm_sensor_ps-stop
}}}
  * Edit /etc/nsm/$HOSTNAME-$INTERFACE/sensor.conf and change IDS_LB_PROCS to desired number of cores
  * Start sensor processes:
{{{
sudo nsm_sensor_ps-start
}}}

If running Snort, the script automatically spawns $IDS_LB_PROCS instances
of Snort (using PF_RING), barnyard2, and snort_agent.<br>
If running Suricata, the script automatically copies IDS_LB_PROCS into
suricata.yaml and then Suricata spins up the PF_RING instances itself.

For Bro, you would edit {{{/opt/bro/etc/node.cfg}}} and change the {{{lb_procs}}}
variable, then do:
{{{
sudo broctl install
sudo broctl restart
}}}
