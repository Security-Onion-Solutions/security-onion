#summary Common scenarios that prevent booting

= Why won't the ISO image boot on my machine? =
  * Did you verify the checksum of the downloaded ISO as described on the [Installation] page?  
  * Does your machine support 64-bit?  (If you're trying to run a 64-bit VM, then your 64-bit processor must support virtualization and virtualization must be enabled in the BIOS.)  If not, then you'll need to obtain a 64-bit machine to use our 64-bit ISO image (recommended) or use your 32-bit machine by installing Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit and adding our PPA and packages as described on the [Installation] page.
  * If you think your machine does support 64-bit, but you're still having problems with our 64-bit ISO image, try downloading the Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit ISO image and seeing if it runs.  If it doesn't, then you should verify your 64-bit compatibility.
  * If the ISO image boots, but the Live Desktop doesn't appear properly, it may be an issue with your video card.  Try the nomodeset option on the boot menu:<br>

If that works but you are left with low resolution and you have an nvidia graphics chipset, you can do the following AFTER installation:
{{{
sudo apt-get remove nvidia-173
sudo apt-get remove nvidia-96
sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
}}}
