Sguil Username:  sguil<br>

<br>
Security Onion 20110101 has a new Setup script that allows you to set your own username/password for Sguil.

= What is the root password? =

Like other Ubuntu-based distributions, there is no root password.  To perform administrative tasks, use the securityonion account (it has been added to /etc/sudoers).  Graphical utilities requesting administrative access should prompt for password; enter the securityonion password.  Command-line utilities that require administrative access can be prefixed with "sudo".  For example, to add a user:<br>
sudo adduser mynewuseraccount

Older versions of Security Onion had the MySQL password set to:<br>
securityonion<br>

Security Onion 20110101 has a blank MySQL password to allow the NSMnow administration scripts to add/delete sensors properly.

= What to I need to modify in order to have the log files stored on a different mount point? =

There are two ways to do this:<br>
- Mount a separate drive to /nsm.  This can be done in the Ubuntu installer or after installation is complete.<br>
OR<br>
- Make /nsm a symlink to the new logging location.  If you do this, you'll need to do the following to avoid AppArmor issues:<br>
 - go to /etc/apparmor.d<br>
 - edit usr.sbin.mysqld, copy the nsm line, and change /nsm to the new location<br>
 - edit usr.sbin.tcpdump, copy the nsm line, and change /nsm to the new location<br>
 - service apparmor restart<br>
