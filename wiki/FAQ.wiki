= What is the root password? =

Like other Ubuntu-based distributions, there is no root password.  Your default user account has been given sudo permissions.  Graphical utilities requesting administrative access should prompt for password; enter your user password. Command-line utilities that require administrative access can be prefixed with "sudo". For example, to add a user:<br>
sudo adduser mynewuseraccount

= What is the Squert password? =

Squert authenticates against the Sguil username database, so you should be able to login to Squert using the same username/password you use to login to Sguil.

= What is the MySQL password? =

Security Onion has a blank MySQL password to allow the NSMnow administration scripts to add/delete sensors properly.  MySQL only allows connections from localhost.  Once you've run through Setup and configured your sensors, you might want to change the MySQL password.

= Why is my disk filling up? =
Sguil uses Snort to record full packet captures to disk.  These pcaps are stored in /nsm/sensor_data/NAME_OF_SENSOR/dailylogs/.  There is a cronjob at /etc/cron.d/sensor-newday that should delete old pcaps when the disk reaches 90% of capacity.  However, if the OS timezone is NOT set to UTC, this script may not be purging correctly.  Make sure your OS timezone is set to UTC.<br>

= How do I set the OS timezone to UTC? =
{{{
echo "Etc/UTC" | sudo tee /etc/timezone
sudo dpkg-reconfigure --frontend noninteractive tzdata
}}}

= What to I need to modify in order to have the log files stored on a different mount point? =

There are two ways to do this:<br>
- Mount a separate drive to /nsm.  This can be done in the Ubuntu installer or after installation is complete.<br>
OR<br>
- Make /nsm a symlink to the new logging location.  If you do this, you'll need to do the following to avoid AppArmor issues:<br>
 - go to /etc/apparmor.d<br>
 - edit usr.sbin.mysqld, copy the nsm line, and change /nsm to the new location<br>
 - edit usr.sbin.tcpdump, copy the nsm line, and change /nsm to the new location<br>
 - service apparmor restart<br>

= How do I configure Sguil to send alerts via email? =

= How do I change the fonts in the Sguil client? =

In the Sguil client, click the File menu and then go to "Change Font".  You can change both the Standard and Fixed fonts.  Fonts are a personal issue, but I like the following:<br>
Standard: Liberation Sans, size 8<br>
Fixed: Liberation Mono, size 8<br>

= How do I boot Security Onion to text mode (CLI instead of GUI)? =
In /etc/default/grub, change this line:<br>
{{{
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="splash quiet"
}}}
to:<br>
{{{
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="text"
}}}

Then run:<br>
{{{
sudo update-grub
}}}
