#summary Frequently Asked Questions

= What's the recommended procedure for installing Security Onion? =

- Boot the ISO and select Install (either from the boot menu or from the Live desktop).<br>
- Follow the prompts in the installer.  When asked about partitioning, you should create a dedicated /nsm partition and assign a good amount of disk space to it since this partition will be storing full packet captures.<br>
- Reboot into your new installation and login with the credentials you
specified in the installer.<br>
- Install Ubuntu updates using the Update Manager in the upper right corner.<br>
- Double-click the Setup shortcut and follow the prompts.<br>
- Use Sguil or Squert to manage your IDS alerts.<br>

= What is the root password? =

Like other Ubuntu-based distributions, there is no root password.  To perform administrative tasks, use the securityonion account (it has been added to /etc/sudoers).  Graphical utilities requesting administrative access should prompt for password; enter the securityonion password.  Command-line utilities that require administrative access can be prefixed with "sudo".  For example, to add a user:<br>
sudo adduser mynewuseraccount

= What is the MySQL password? =

Security Onion has a blank MySQL password to allow the NSMnow administration scripts to add/delete sensors properly.  MySQL only allows connections from localhost.  Once you've run through Setup and configured your sensors, you might want to change the MySQL password.

= Where do I send questions/problems/suggestions? =

= What to I need to modify in order to have the log files stored on a different mount point? =

There are two ways to do this:<br>
- Mount a separate drive to /nsm.  This can be done in the Ubuntu installer or after installation is complete.<br>
OR<br>
- Make /nsm a symlink to the new logging location.  If you do this, you'll need to do the following to avoid AppArmor issues:<br>
 - go to /etc/apparmor.d<br>
 - edit usr.sbin.mysqld, copy the nsm line, and change /nsm to the new location<br>
 - edit usr.sbin.tcpdump, copy the nsm line, and change /nsm to the new location<br>
 - service apparmor restart<br>
