= Can Security Onion run in IPS mode? =
Running Security Onion as an IPS requires manual configuration and is not supported.  I talked about this on the Packet Pushers podcast:
http://packetpushers.net/show-95-security-onion-with-doug-burks-or-why-ids-rules-and-ips-drools/

= Why do I get segfaults when booting on VMware ESX? =
This is a known issue with Ubuntu 10.04 and ESXi 4.1 and is unrelated to Security Onion.  Please see:<br>
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1674759<br>
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/659422<br>

= Why is my disk filling up? =
Sguil uses daemonlogger to record full packet captures to disk.  These pcaps are stored in /nsm/sensor_data/NAME_OF_SENSOR/dailylogs/.  There is an hourly cronjob at /etc/cron.d/sensor-clean that should delete old pcaps when the disk reaches 90% of capacity.  It's important to properly size your disk storage so that you avoid filling the disk to 100% before the next hourly purge runs.<br>

= Why does Security Onion use UTC? =
Security Onion uses UTC because that is the recommended/required setting for Sguil:<br>
<a href="http://osdir.com/ml/security.sguil.general/2008-09/msg00003.html">http://osdir.com/ml/security.sguil.general/2008-09/msg00003.html</a><br>
<a href="https://forums.snort.org/forums/linux/topics/barnyard-sguil-time-problem">https://forums.snort.org/forums/linux/topics/barnyard-sguil-time-problem</a><br>
<br>
Trying to use a non-UTC timezone can result in the following:<br>
- Time zones that have daylight saving time have a one-hour time warp twice a year.  This manifests itself in Sguil not being able to pull transcripts for events within that one-hour time period.  This is avoided by using UTC, since there is no daylight saving time.<br>
- Something similar can happen on a daily basis under certain conditions.  If there is a discrepancy between the OS timezone and the Sguil UTC settings, then Sguil will be unable to pull transcripts for events in a window of time around midnight coinciding with the timezone's offset from UTC.<br>
Additionally, UTC comes in quite handy when you have sensors in different time zones and/or are trying to correlate events with other systems or teams.<br>
The Setup wizard (/usr/local/bin/setup) does the following to set the OS and all services to UTC:
{{{
echo "Etc/UTC" | sudo tee /etc/timezone
sudo dpkg-reconfigure --frontend noninteractive tzdata
sudo service rsyslog restart
sudo cp /etc/localtime /var/ossec/etc/localtime
sudo chown root:ossec /var/ossec/etc/localtime
sudo service ossec restart
}}}

= What to I need to modify in order to have the log files stored on a different mount point? =

There are two ways to do this:<br>
- Mount a separate drive to /nsm.  This can be done in the Ubuntu installer or after installation is complete.<br>
OR<br>
- Make /nsm a symlink to the new logging location.  If you do this, you'll need to do the following to avoid AppArmor issues:<br>
 - go to /etc/apparmor.d<br>
 - edit usr.sbin.mysqld, copy the nsm line, and change /nsm to the new location<br>
 - edit usr.sbin.tcpdump, copy the nsm line, and change /nsm to the new location<br>
 - service apparmor restart<br>

= How do I stop monitoring an interface? =
Execute the following command, replacing HOSTNAME-INTERFACE with the name of the sensor:
{{{
sudo nsm_sensor_ps-stop --sensor-name=HOSTNAME-INTERFACE
}}}
Then remove the relevant entry from /etc/nsm/sensortab.

= How do I change the fonts in the Sguil client? =

In the Sguil client, click the File menu and then go to "Change Font".  You can change both the Standard and Fixed fonts.  Fonts are a personal issue, but I like the following:<br>
Standard: Liberation Sans, size 8<br>
Fixed: Liberation Mono, size 8<br>

= How do I boot Security Onion to text mode (CLI instead of GUI)? =
In /etc/default/grub, change this line:<br>
{{{
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="splash quiet"
}}}
to:<br>
{{{
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="text"
}}}

Then run:<br>
{{{
sudo update-grub
}}}

= Why can't I upgrade past version 20110628? = 

If your /etc/nsm/securityonion.conf says:<br>
{{{
VERSION=20110628
}}}
<br>
and if running the upgrade says:<br>
{{{
Your Security Onion installation is up to date.
}}}
<br>
then a previous upgrade from 20110628 to 20110709 was interrupted.  This upgrade changed the config file format from spaces to equal signs.  Edit the VERSION in /etc/nsm/securityonion.conf as follows:<br>
{{{
VERSION=20110709
}}}
<br>
and then re-run the upgrade.<br>

= I'm running Security Onion in a VM and the screensaver is using lots of CPU.  How do I change/disable the screensaver? =
  # Click Applications.<br>
  # Click Settings.<br>
  # Click Screensaver.<br>
  # Screensaver Preferences window appears.  Click the Mode dropdown and select "Disable Screen Saver" or "Blank Screen Only".<br>
  # Close the Screensaver Preferences window.<br>

= I'm currently running Snort.  How do I switch to Suricata? =
First, make sure you're running the latest version of Security Onion.  Then run the following commands:
{{{
sudo nsm_sensor_ps-stop --only-snort-alert
sudo sed -i 's|ENGINE=snort|ENGINE=suricata|g' /etc/nsm/securityonion.conf
sudo /usr/local/bin/pulledpork_update.sh 
}}}

= I'm currently running Suricata.  How do I switch to Snort? =
First, make sure you're running the latest version of Security Onion.  Then run the following commands:
{{{
sudo nsm_sensor_ps-stop --only-snort-alert
sudo sed -i 's|ENGINE=suricata|ENGINE=snort|g' /etc/nsm/securityonion.conf
sudo /usr/local/bin/pulledpork_update.sh 
}}}

= How do I add a new user to Sguil? =
You can add new Sguil user accounts with the following (if prompted for server name, enter "securityonion"):<br>
{{{
sudo /usr/local/sbin/nsm_server_user-add
}}}

= I get periodic MySQL crashes and/or error code 24 "out of resources" when searching in Sguil.  How do I fix that? =
First, stop sguil and mysql:
{{{
sudo nsm_server_ps-stop
sudo service mysql stop
}}}
Next, edit /etc/mysql/my.cnf and add the following in the [mysqld] section:
{{{
open-files-limit        = 4096
}}}
Finally, start mysql and sguil:
{{{
sudo service mysql start
sudo nsm_server_ps-start
}}}

= How can I add and test local rules? = 
[AddingLocalRules Adding local rules and testing them with scapy]

= Why is the Snorby dashboard not displaying correctly?  Why do I have to restart the Sensor Cache job periodically? =
All known issues with the dashboard and sensor cache job have been resolved with the release of Snorby 2.5.1 in Security Onion 20120321:<br>
<a href="http://securityonion.blogspot.com/2012/03/security-onion-20120321-now-available.html">http://securityonion.blogspot.com/2012/03/security-onion-20120321-now-available.html</a>

= Why isn't Snorby showing GeoIP data properly? =
Try forcing the GeoIP job to run by doing the following:
{{{
cd /usr/local/share/snorby/
sudo RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails c
Snorby::Jobs::GeoipUpdatedbJob.new(true).perform
quit
}}}

= Why does Snort segfault every day at 7:01 AM? =
7:01 AM is the time of the daily PulledPork rules update.  If you're running Snort with the VRT ruleset, this includes updating the SO rules.  There is a known issue when running Snort with the VRT ruleset and updating the SO rules:<br>
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/pulledpork-users/1bQDkh3AhNs/discussion">https://groups.google.com/d/topic/pulledpork-users/1bQDkh3AhNs/discussion</a><br>
After updating the rules, Snort is restarted, and the segfault occurs in the OLD instance of Snort (not the NEW instance).  Therefore, the segfault is merely a nuisance log entry and can safely be ignored.

= Barnyard2 is failing with an error like "ERROR: sguil: Expected Confirm 13324 and got: Failed to insert 13324: mysqlexec/db server: Duplicate entry '9-13324' for key 'PRIMARY'".  How do I fix this? =

Sometimes, just restarting Barnyard will clear this up:
{{{
sudo nsm_sensor_ps-restart --only-barnyard2
}}}

Other times, restarting Sguild and then restarting Barnyard will clear it up:
{{{
sudo nsm_server_ps-restart
sudo nsm_sensor_ps-restart --only-barnyard2
}}}

If that doesn't work, then try also restarting mysql:
{{{
sudo service mysql restart
sudo nsm_server_ps-restart
sudo nsm_sensor_ps-restart --only-barnyard2
}}}

If that still doesn't fix it, you may have to perform MySQL surgery on the database "securityonion_db" as described in the Sguil FAQ:

= How do I access Xplico with a hostname instead of IP address? =
From Gianluca Costa:<br>
<br>
Xplico has embedded (in its PHP code) a Http-proxy, this proxy is used to show the web pages, emulating, for example, the original cache of the user.
By default the XI url must be an IP address (wiki: http://wiki.xplico.org/doku.php?id=interface#browser ), the only exception to this rule is the url http://demo.xplico.org (for obvious reasons).
If you use as url a name (not an ip) then XI give you a blank page, because XI searches your url in the decoded data.

To change this behavior you must modify the PHP code:<br>
 - file /opt/xplico/xi/cake/dispatcher.php<br>
 - replace demo.xplico.org with your host name (used in the url)<br>

= What's the difference between a "server" and a "sensor"? =
box<br>
Definition: A physical or virtual machine running the Security Onion operating system.<br>
<br>
server<br>
Definition: A set of processes that receive data from sensors and allow analysts to see and investigate that data.  The set of processes includes sguild, mysql, and snorby.  The server is also responsible for ruleset management.<br>
Naming convention: The collection of server processes has a server name separate from the hostname of the box.  Security Onion always sets the server name to "securityonion".<br>
Configuration files: /etc/nsm/securityonion/<br>
Controlled by:  /usr/local/sbin/nsm_server <br>
<br>
server box<br>
Definition: A machine running the server processes.  May optionally be running sensor processes.<br>
Example 1: User runs Quick Setup on machine with hostname securityonion and two ethernet interfaces.  Setup creates a server and two sensors (securityonion-eth0 and securityonion-eth1).<br>
Example 2: User runs Advanced Setup and chooses Server.  Setup creates a server only (no sensor processes).<br>
<br>
sensor<br>
Definition: A set of processes listening on a network interface.  The set of processes currently includes Snort/Suricata, daemonlogger, sancp, argus, pads, httpry, and bro (although this is in constant flux as we add new capabilities and find better tools for existing capabilities).<br>
Naming convention: $HOSTNAME-$INTERFACE<br>
Configuration files: /etc/nsm/$HOSTNAME-$INTERFACE/<br>
Example: sensor1-eth0<br>
Controlled by:  /usr/local/sbin/nsm_sensor<br>
<br>
sensor box<br>
Definition: A machine having one or more sensors that transmit to a central server.  Does not run server processes.  Pulls ruleset from server box.  (In some contexts, I refer to this a slave pulling rules from the master.)<br>
Example: A machine named sensor1 having sensors sensor1-eth0 and sensor1-eth1.<br>
