= What's the recommended procedure for installing Security Onion? =

- If you're just evaluating Security Onion, the short answer is:<br>
  # Hardware requirements: you might be able to get by with 512MB RAM, but you really need 1GB or more.  Be aware that full packet capture may fill your disk quickly, so size your storage appropriately.<br>
  # <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/security-onion/files/">Download</a>, verify, and boot the ISO image.<br>
  # Run through the Xubuntu installer.<br>
  # Reboot into your new installation and double-click the Setup shortcut.  Follow the prompts.<br>
  # Analyze alerts using Sguil, Squert, or Snorby.<br>
<br>
- If you're going to be deploying Security Onion in production, the longer answer is as follows:<br>
<br>
  # Before you start, make sure your sensor(s) are capable.  Check the [Hardware] page.<br>
  # <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/security-onion/files/">Download the most recent Security Onion ISO image from here</a> (you may have to scroll to the bottom of the page).<br>
  # Verify the MD5 and/or SHA1 checksums of the downloaded ISO image. There is an accompanying .md5 file or you can use the MD5/SHA1 checksums that Sourceforge displays when clicking the Information (view details) button to the right of the ISO image (it's a circle with an "i").<br>
  # (If deploying a master server and one or more slave sensors, you'll need to perform the remaining steps on the server and all sensors, but make sure you install/configure the master first.)<br>
  # Boot the ISO and select Install (either from the boot menu or from the Live desktop).<br>
  # Follow the prompts in the installer.  When asked about partitioning, there are a few things to keep in mind:
    * If you have more than 2TB of disk space, you will probably want to create a dedicated /boot partition at the beginning of the disk to ensure that you don't have any Grub booting issues.  
    * You may want to put /nsm on a dedicated partition/disk and assign a good amount of disk space since it will be storing full packet captures.  
  # Reboot into your new installation and login with the credentials you specified in the installer.<br>
  # <a href="http://code.google.com/p/security-onion/wiki/NetworkConfiguration">Configure networking.</a><br>
  # If you're behind a proxy, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/security-onion/wiki/Proxy">configure your proxy settings</a>.<br>
  # If your machine has more than 4GB of RAM, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnablingPAE">install the PAE kernel</a>.<br>
  # Install Ubuntu updates using the Update Manager in the upper right corner and reboot if necessary.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/security-onion/wiki/tcl">tcl/tk updates are on hold and you should NOT attempt to manually install any tcl/tk updates!</a>  You may want to <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates">configure Ubuntu to automatically install updates</a>.  <br>
  # <a href="http://code.google.com/p/security-onion/wiki/Upgrade">Install Security Onion updates</a>.<br>
  # Double-click the Setup shortcut on the Desktop and follow the prompts.  If this is a sensor that will report to a master server, then Setup will prompt you for an SSH account on the master server that has sudo privileges.  Consider creating a separate SSH account on the master server for each sensor so that if a sensor is ever compromised, its individual account can be disabled without affecting the other sensors.<br>
  # If you're monitoring IP address ranges other than the private RFC1918 address space (192.168.0.0/16,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12), you should update your sensor configuration with the correct IP ranges.  Sensor configuration files can be found in /etc/nsm/HOSTNAME-INTERFACE/.  Modify either snort.conf or suricata.yaml (depending on which IDS engine you chose during Setup) and update the HOME_NET variable.  Also update sancp.conf and pads.conf.  Then update Bro's network configuration in /usr/local/etc/networks.cfg.  Finally, restart the sensor processes:
{{{
sudo nsm_sensor_ps-restart
}}}
  # If you have Internet access, create an IDS alert by typing the following at a terminal:<br>
{{{
curl http://testmyids.com
}}}
  # Full-time analysts should run Security Onion in a VM on their workstation, then launch the Sguil client and connect to the IP/hostname of their production Sguil sensor.  This allows you to investigate pcaps without fear of impacting your production server/sensors.  To change the resolution of your Security Onion VM, install the Virtual Tools for your virtualization solution or use xrandr.  For a list of available screen resolutions, simply execute "xrandr".  To set the screen resolution (replace W and H with the actual Width and Height desired):
{{{
xrandr -s WxH
}}}
  # Login to Sguil, Squert (https://server/squert/), or Snorby (https://server:3000) and review your IDS alerts.  Use the additional NSM data types in Sguil and Bro logs (/nsm/bro/logs/) for in-depth analysis.<br>
  # Run the following to see how your sensor is coping with the load.  You should check this on a daily basis to make sure your sensor is not dropping packets.  Consider adding it to a cronjob and having it emailed to you (see the "configure email" link below).
{{{
sudo sostat | less
}}}
  # Please note that any IDS/NSM system needs to be tuned for the network it's monitoring.  Please see [ManagingAlerts].  You should only run the signatures you really care about.
  # Also note that you should be looking at and categorizing events every day with the goal being to categorize all events every day.  Even if you don't use the Sguil console for your primary analysis, you need to log into into it periodically and F8 old events to keep the RealTime queue from getting too big.  Neglecting to do so may result in database/Sguil issues as the number of uncategorized events continues to increase on a daily basis.<br> 
  # Optional: Exclude unnecessary traffic from your monitoring using [BPF].
  # Optional: add new Sguil user accounts with the following:<br>
{{{
sudo /usr/local/sbin/nsm_server_user-add
}}}
  # Optional: [Email configure email for alerting and reporting]
  # Optional: Need "remote desktop" access to your Security Onion sensor? [FreeNX Install FreeNX.]
