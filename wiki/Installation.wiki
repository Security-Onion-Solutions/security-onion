= What's the recommended procedure for installing Security Onion? =

- <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/security-onion/files/">Download the most recent Security Onion ISO image from here</a> (you may have to scroll to the bottom of the page).<br>
- Verify the MD5 and/or SHA1 checksums of the downloaded ISO image.<br>
- Boot the ISO and select Install (either from the boot menu or from the Live desktop).<br>
