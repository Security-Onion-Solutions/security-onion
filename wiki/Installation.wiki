= What's the recommended procedure for installing Security Onion? =

- <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/security-onion/files/">Download the most recent Security Onion ISO image from here</a> (you may have to scroll to the bottom of the page).<br>
<br>
- Verify the MD5 and/or SHA1 checksums of the downloaded ISO image. There is an accompanying .md5 file or you can use the MD5/SHA1 checksums that Sourceforge displays when clicking the Information button.<br>
<br>
- Boot the ISO and select Install (either from the boot menu or from the Live desktop).<br>
<br>
- Follow the prompts in the installer.  When asked about partitioning, you may want to put /nsm on a dedicated partition/disk and assign a good amount of disk space since it will be storing full packet captures.<br>
<br>
- Reboot into your new installation and login with the credentials you
specified in the installer.<br>
<br>
- <a href="http://code.google.com/p/security-onion/wiki/NetworkConfiguration">Configure networking.</a><br>

}}}
