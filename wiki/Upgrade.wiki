#summary Security Onion Upgrade Procedure

= Security Onion 12.04 Update Procedure =

Since all of our packages are in a standard Ubuntu Launchpad PPA, you can use standard Ubuntu package management tools to update ALL packages (Ubuntu and Security Onion).  For example:
{{{
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}}

There are two special cases to be aware of when updating:

  # MySQL
If you've already run Setup, please see the [MySQLUpdates recommended procedure for updating the MySQL packages].

  # PF_RING and new kernel packages
You may be prompted to update your kernel packages and PF_RING at the same time.  If you do so, the PF_RING kernel module will get built for your current kernel and not for the newly installed kernel.  You should install JUST the updated kernel packages, reboot, and then install the updated PF_RING packages so that the module gets built properly for the new kernel.  If you accidentally install both the kernel and PF_RING packages at the same time and then reboot and find out that PF_RING services are failing, you can force PF_RING to build against the new kernel by simply running the update command again:
{{{
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}}

= Security Onion 10.04 Update Procedure =

If you're behind a proxy server, make sure that you've configured your proxy server settings as shown <a href="http://code.google.com/p/security-onion/wiki/Proxy">here</a>.  Then run the following command (be sure to copy the entire line):
{{{
sudo -i "curl -L http://sourceforge.net/projects/security-onion/files/security-onion-upgrade.sh > ~/security-onion-upgrade.sh && bash ~/security-onion-upgrade.sh"
}}}

== Please note there is no in-place upgrade from Security Onion 10.04 to Security Onion 12.04 since most folks will be migrating from 32-bit to 64-bit.==
