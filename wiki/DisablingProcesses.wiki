#summary Disabling Services after Setup

= Disabling a process =
If you've already run Setup and want to disable a certain sensor service, you can simply stop the running service and then change the corresponding config value from "yes" to "no" to prevent it from restarting the next time the NSM scripts are run. 

For example, suppose you access Bro's HTTP logs via ELSA, so you want to disable http_agent to prevent those HTTP logs from being duplicated into the Sguil database.  You would first stop the running http_agent service:
{{{
sudo nsm_sensor_ps-stop --only-http-agent
}}}
You would then edit /etc/nsm/HOSTNAME-INTERFACE/sensor.conf and change:
{{{
HTTP_AGENT_ENABLED="yes"
}}}
to:
{{{
HTTP_AGENT_ENABLED="no"
}}}
to prevent http_agent from restarting the next time the NSM scripts are run.  A quick way to do this for all /etc/nsm/`*`/sensor.conf files on one box is to use the sed command as follows:
{{{
sudo sed -i 's|HTTP_AGENT_ENABLED="yes"|HTTP_AGENT_ENABLED="no"|g' /etc/nsm/*/sensor.conf
}}}

= Sguil Agent =
If you use the Sguil client and want to remove the disabled agent from Sguil's "Agent Status" tab, then stop sguild, set the sensor's "active" field to N in the database, and then restart sguild:
{{{
# Stop sguild
sudo nsm_server_ps-stop

# Set active="N", replacing HOSTNAME-INTERFACE-INSTANCE with your actual HOSTNAME, INTERFACE, and INSTANCE
mysql -uroot -Dsecurityonion_db -e 'update sensor set active="N" where hostname="HOSTNAME-INTERFACE-INSTANCE";'

# Restart sguild
sudo nsm_server_ps-start
}}}
