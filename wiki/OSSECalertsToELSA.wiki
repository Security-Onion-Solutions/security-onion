#summary Configuring OSSEC to send alerts to ELSA

Previously, when a user ran Setup and enabled ELSA, they would be able to log into ELSA and view OSSEC *archive* logs (the raw logs received by OSSEC) but they wouldn't be able to view OSSEC *alerts* (created based on OSSEC's analysis of the incoming logs as configured by the OSSEC ruleset).  I've pushed a new Setup package that will configure OSSEC to send alerts to local syslog if the user enables ELSA.

If you've already run Setup and would like to configure OSSEC to send alerts to ELSA, you can manually perform the following steps.
{{{
sed -i 's|  <rules>|  <syslog_output>\
      <server>127.0.0.1</server>\
  </syslog_output>\
\
  <rules>|g' /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
}}}
Then run the following commands:
{{{
sudo /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control enable client-syslog
sudo service ossec-hids-server restart
}}}
