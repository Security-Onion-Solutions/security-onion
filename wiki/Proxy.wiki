#summary Proxy Configuration

= What do I need to do if I'm behind a proxy? =

Put your proxy server settings in /etc/environment like this:<br>
{{{
export http_proxy=https://server:port
export https_proxy=https://server:port
export ftp_proxy=https://server:port
export PERL_LWP_ENV_PROXY=https://server:port
export no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1"
}}}
If you're going to run something using sudo, remember to use the "-i" option to force it to process the environment variables.  For example:<br>
{{{
sudo -i rule-update
}}}

For certain proxies (Bluecoat in particular), you may need to change from https to http in /etc/nsm/pulledpork/pulledpork.conf.  For more information, please see:
