#summary Integration with Third Party Systems

= Introduction =

Many organizations would like to take data from Security Onion and send it to third party systems.

= Support =

Unfortunately, we don't have the resources to support third party systems, so this wiki page will be just a brief introduction to how you would accomplish this.

=How do I send Bro and OSSEC logs to an external syslog collector?=
Configure /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf with a new "destination" to forward to your external syslog collector and then restart syslog-ng.

=How do I send IDS alerts to an external system?=

2 options:

- On your master server (running sguild), configure /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf with a new "source" to monitor /var/log/nsm/securityonion/sguild.log for "Alert Received" lines and a new "destination" to send to your external system, and then restart syslog-ng.

OR

- Edit ALL /etc/nsm/HOSTNAME-INTERFACE/barnyard2.conf files on ALL sensors with a new "output" to send IDS alerts to your external systems and then restart all barnyard2 instances.
