#summary The Future of Security Onion
Please note that this is all subject to change!
  * June/July/August/September/October 2012
    * Issue 247:  Big Distro Rebuild (BDR)
      * Development on the existing 32-bit version of Security Onion will stop so that we can focus on the future
      * Launchpad PPA so that all updates (Ubuntu and Security Onion) are done via apt-get
      * ISO image will be based on Xubuntu 12.04 64-bit, but you'll be able to use your preferred flavor of Ubuntu and just add our PPA
      * There will be no in-place upgrade path since we're moving from 32-bit to 64-bit
      * Snort and Bro will use pf_ring for higher performance
