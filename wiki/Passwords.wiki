#summary Passwords

= Introduction =

This page answers several frequently asked questions about system account passwords.


= Details =

= What is the root password? =

Like other Ubuntu-based distributions, there is no root password. Your default user account has been given sudo permissions. Graphical utilities requesting administrative access should prompt for password; enter your user password. Command-line utilities that require administrative access can be prefixed with "sudo". For example, to add a user:
sudo adduser mynewuseraccount

= What is the Squert password? =
Squert authenticates against the Sguil username database, so you should be able to login to Squert using the same username/password you use to login to Sguil.

= What is the MySQL password? =
Security Onion has a blank MySQL password to allow the NSMnow administration scripts to add/delete sensors properly. MySQL only allows connections from localhost. Once you've run through Setup and configured your sensors, you might want to change the MySQL password.
