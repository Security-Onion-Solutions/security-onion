#summary Passwords

= OS root account =

Like other Ubuntu-based distributions, there is no root password. Your default user account has been given sudo permissions. Graphical utilities requesting administrative access should prompt for password; enter your user password. Command-line utilities that require administrative access can be prefixed with "sudo". For example, to add a user:
sudo adduser mynewuseraccount

= Sguil =
Log into Sguil using the username/password you created in the Setup wizard.

= Squert =
Squert authenticates against the Sguil user database, so you should be able to login to Squert using the same username/password you use to login to Sguil.

= ELSA =
ELSA authenticates against the Sguil user database, so you should be able to login to Squert using the same username/password you use to login to Sguil.

= Snorby =
Snorby does not authenticate against the Sguil user database.  Log into Snorby using the EMAIL ADDRESS and password you specified in Setup.

= MySQL =
The MySQL root password is null to allow the NSMnow administration scripts to add/delete sensors properly. MySQL only allows connections from localhost.  If you need to look at the database manually, you can do so like this:
{{{
mysql -uroot
}}}

= Xplico =
We use the default Xplico credentials as listed here:
