#summary Security Onion 12.04 Beta

= Introduction =

Security Onion 12.04 Beta is now available and ready for testing!  Thanks to everybody who has helped get us this far!

Please note that this is not ready for production usage yet.  We're still in BETA and I reserve the right to break all the packages in the "test" repo at any time! 

= Hardware recommendations =
1GB RAM for the core OS<br>
+1GB RAM for EACH monitored network interface <br>
+ >=512MB RAM if you choose to enable ELSA 

= Installation Instructions =

  * Install your desired flavor of Ubuntu 12.04 (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, or Ubuntu Server). 
  * Apply any available Ubuntu updates and reboot if necessary.
  * If you're running a VM, now would be a good time to snapshot it so you can revert later if you need to.
  * Tell MySQL not to prompt for root password: 
{{{
echo "debconf debconf/frontend select noninteractive" | sudo debconf-set-selections  
}}}
  * Add our test repo and install ALL packages.  This could take 5 minutes or more depending on your CPU/Internet: 
{{{
sudo apt-get -y install python-software-properties
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:securityonion/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install securityonion-all 
}}}
  * Run the Setup wizard
{{{
sudo sosetup
}}}
