#summary Security Onion 12.04 Beta

= Introduction =

Security Onion 12.04 Beta is now available and ready for testing!  Thanks to everybody who has helped get us this far!

All of our packages are in an Ubuntu Launchpad PPA.  That means you can start with your preferred flavor of Ubuntu 12.04, add our PPA and packages, and be up an running in just a few minutes!

Please keep in mind that this is not ready for production usage yet.  We're still in BETA and I reserve the right to break all the packages in the "test" repo at any time!

= RAM Minimum Requirements =
512MB - 1GB RAM for the core OS (512MB for Ubuntu Server with no GUI)<br>
+512MB RAM for the server components (apache, sguild, Snorby, ELSA web, etc.)<br>
+1GB RAM for EACH network interface that you choose to monitor <br>
+ >=512MB RAM if you choose to enable ELSA 

= Hardware Recommendations =
  * 64-bit<br>
  * Intel NICs<br>
  * as much RAM as your server holds!<br>
  * as much Disk as your server holds!<br>

= Installation Instructions =

  * Download your desired flavor of Ubuntu 12.04.  You should be able to use 32-bit or 64-bit, but 64-bit is highly recommended (assuming your hardware supports it):
   * Ubuntu Server (no GUI)- http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server
   * Ubuntu Desktop - http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop
   * Kubuntu - http://www.kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/download
   * Xubuntu - http://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/
   * Lubuntu - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/GetLubuntu
  * Verify the checksum of the downloaded ISO image.
  * Boot the ISO image, proceed through the Ubuntu installer, and reboot into your new installation.
  * Apply any available Ubuntu updates and reboot:
{{{
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo reboot
}}}
  * If you're running a VM, now would be a good time to snapshot it so you can revert later if you need to.
  * Tell MySQL not to prompt for root password: 
{{{
echo "debconf debconf/frontend select noninteractive" | sudo debconf-set-selections  
}}}
  * Add our test repo and install ALL packages.  This could take 15 minutes or more depending on your CPU/Internet: 
{{{
sudo apt-get -y install python-software-properties
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:securityonion/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install securityonion-all 
}}}
  * Run the Setup wizard
{{{
sudo sosetup
}}}
  * Follow the prompts!
  * Once you've completed the Setup wizard, open the Chromium web browser and go to https://localhost for links to Squert, Snorby, and ELSA.
  * To launch the Sguil client, find the icon in the Security Onion menu (Xubuntu/Lubuntu) or just type:
{{{
sguil.tk
}}}

= Metapackages =
The instructions above used the securityonion-all metapackage to install ALL of our individual packages (about 350MB).  We have some more focused metapackages that you can use for a more focused deployment:
  * securityonion-client (about 50MB)
  * securityonion-sensor (about 50MB)
  * securityonion-elsa and securityonion-elsa-extras (about 50MB)
  * securityonion-server (about 200MB)

= Known Issues: OSSEC Upgrade =
If you're currently testing the new Security Onion 12.04 Beta and installed the packages before October 4 and do an "apt-get upgrade", the OSSEC package may require some manual intervention: 
  * if prompted about /etc/ossec-init.conf, just press Enter to accept the default of "N, keep the current version" 
  * afterwards, if OSSEC isn't running, then you'll need to purge the package and reinstall it: 
{{{
sudo apt-get purge ossec-hids-server 
}}}
  * this will remove some securityonion metapackages, so let's reinstall them (and OSSEC):
{{{
sudo apt-get -y install securityonion-all 
}}}

= Known Issues: PRADS =
PRADS is a replacement for both PADS and SANCP.  There are several known issues with PRADS:<br>
https://github.com/gamelinux/prads/issues/19<br>
https://github.com/gamelinux/prads/issues/21<br>

= Known Issues: daemonlogger and netsniff-ng =
We still need to replace daemonlogger with netsniff-ng for higher performance.
