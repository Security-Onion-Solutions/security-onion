#summary Security Onion 12.04 Beta

= Introduction =

Security Onion 12.04 Beta is now available and ready for testing!  Thanks to everybody who has helped get us this far!

All of our packages are in an Ubuntu Launchpad PPA.  That means you can start with your preferred flavor of Ubuntu 12.04, add our PPA and packages, and be up an running in just a few minutes!

Please keep in mind that this is not ready for production usage yet.  We're still in BETA and I reserve the right to break all the packages in the "test" repo at any time!

= Hardware recommendations =
512MB - 1GB RAM for the core OS (512MB for Ubuntu Server with no GUI)<br>
+512MB RAM for the server components (apache, sguild, Snorby, ELSA web, etc.)<br>
+1GB RAM for EACH network interface that you choose to monitor <br>
+ >=512MB RAM if you choose to enable ELSA 

LOTS of disk space for full packet capture!

= Installation Instructions =

  * Install your desired flavor of Ubuntu 12.04 (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, or Ubuntu Server). 
  * Apply any available Ubuntu updates and reboot if necessary.
  * If you're running a VM, now would be a good time to snapshot it so you can revert later if you need to.
  * Tell MySQL not to prompt for root password: 
{{{
echo "debconf debconf/frontend select noninteractive" | sudo debconf-set-selections  
}}}
  * Add our test repo and install ALL packages.  This could take 5 minutes or more depending on your CPU/Internet: 
{{{
sudo apt-get -y install python-software-properties
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:securityonion/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install securityonion-all 
}}}
  * Run the Setup wizard
{{{
sudo sosetup
}}}
  * Follow the prompts!
  * Once you've completed the Setup wizard, open the Chromium web browser and go to https://localhost for links to Squert, Snorby, and ELSA.
  * To open the Sguil client, find the icon in the Security Onion menu (Xubuntu/Lubuntu) or just type:
{{{
sguil.tk
}}}

= Known Issues: OSSEC Upgrade =
If you're currently testing the new Security Onion 12.04 Beta and installed the packages before October 4 and do an "apt-get upgrade", the OSSEC package may require some manual intervention: 
  * if prompted about /etc/ossec-init.conf, just press Enter to accept the default of "N, keep the current version" 
  * afterwards, if OSSEC isn't running, then you'll need to purge the package and reinstall it: 
{{{
sudo apt-get purge ossec-hids-server 
}}}
  * this will remove some securityonion metapackages, so let's reinstall them (and OSSEC):
{{{
sudo apt-get -y install securityonion-all 
}}}

= Known Issues: PRADS =
PRADS is a replacement for both PADS and SANCP.  There are several known issues with PRADS:<br>
https://github.com/gamelinux/prads/issues/19<br>
https://github.com/gamelinux/prads/issues/21<br>

= Known Issues: Bro http.log =
I haven't finished packaging our Bro scripts, so Bro will still be logging all http traffic to http.log per its default.  This is fine if you're only monitoring a single network interface.  But if you're monitoring multiple network interfaces, our scripts expect the http.log to be split per interface.  This means that those monitoring multiple network interfaces won't have http logs in Sguil at the moment.

= Known Issues: daemonlogger and netsniff-ng =
We still need to replace daemonlogger with netsniff-ng for higher performance.
