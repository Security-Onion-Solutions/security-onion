#summary Tuning suggestions for MySQL

= mysqltuner =

Run mysqltuner to get some initial recommendations:
{{{
# Install mysqltuner if you haven't already
sudo apt-get install mysqltuner

# Run mysqltuner
sudo mysqltuner
}}}

= /etc/mysql/my.cnf =

Implement mysqltuner's recommendations in /etc/mysql/my.cnf.  Changes don't take effect until MySQL is restarted and you should ensure that Sguil and other services aren't using MySQL before shutting it down.

= Variables =

Here are some common variables that will probably need to be tuned for your system:

  * key_buffer
  * max_connections
  * table_cache
  * open-files-limit
