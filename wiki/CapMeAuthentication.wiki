#summary CapME Authentication

= CapME Authentication =
Our Setup script automatically configures both Snorby and ELSA to be able to pivot to CapME for full transcripts.  The CapME page will prompt you for username/password and you will enter your normal Sguil/Squert/ELSA username/password.  You have the option of automatically authenticating, but be aware that this will send your username/password in the GET request, so it will be displayed in the browser bar in plaintext.

== Configuring Snorby to auto-authenticate to CapME ==
  * Click "Administration and General Settings".
  * Under OpenFPC, select "Packet capture auto-authenticate" and enter your *Sguil* username and password.
  * Click "Save Settings".

== Configuring ELSA to auto-authenticate to CapME ==
  * Click the ELSA menu and click Preferences.
  * Create a new Preference called "openfpc_username" and enter your *Sguil* username.
  * Create a new Preference called "openfpc_password" and enter your *Sguil* password.
  * Close the Preferences window and reload the ELSA page.
