Optional: if you'd like Snorby to be able to send emails, you'll need to modify a few files (on the master server). First, modify /usr/local/share/snorby/config/snorby_config.yml and change the "domain" setting in the Production section to be the FQDN of your Snorby server. Next, modify /usr/local/share/snorby/config/initializers/mail_config.rb as needed for your mail server.
