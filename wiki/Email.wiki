#summary Configuring email for alerting and reporting
= Introduction =

This page describes how to configure email for alerting and reporting.  Applications such as Snorby, Sguil, and OSSEC have their own mail configuration and don't rely on a mail server in the OS itself.  However, you may still want to install a mail server in the OS so that you can get daily emails from the sostat script.

= How do I configure Snorby to send emails? =
You'll need to modify a few files (on the master server). First, modify /usr/local/share/snorby/config/snorby_config.yml and change the "domain" setting in the Production section to be the FQDN or IP address of your Snorby server. Next, modify /usr/local/share/snorby/config/initializers/mail_config.rb as needed for your mail server.  Then restart the Snorby delayed_job process:
{{{
sudo pkill -f delayed_job
sudo su www-data -c "cd /usr/local/share/snorby; bundle exec rake snorby:update RAILS_ENV=production"
}}}

= How do I configure Sguil to send alerts via email?<br> =
Modify /etc/nsm/securityonion/sguild.email (on the master server) as needed and restart sguild:
{{{
sudo nsm_server_ps-restart
}}}
You can then verify the email configuration by looking at the top of sguild's log file:
{{{
head -20 /var/log/nsm/securityonion/sguild.log
}}}

= How do I configure OSSEC to send emails? =
Modify /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf as follows:
{{{
  <global>
    <email_notification>yes</email_notification>
    <email_to>YourUsername@YourDomain.com</email_to>
    <smtp_server>YourMailRelay.YourDomain.com</smtp_server>
    <email_from>ossec@YourDomain.com</email_from>
    <email_maxperhour>100</email_maxperhour>
  </global>
}}}
Then restart OSSEC:
{{{
sudo service ossec restart
}}}

= How do I configure the OS itself to send emails? =
Install and configure your favorite mail server.  Depending on your needs, this could be something simple like nullmailer or something more complex like exim4:
{{{
# nullmailer instructions provided by Michael Iverson

sudo apt-get install nullmailer
# edit /etc/mailname to hold your "from" domain name. (If you were google, you'd use "gmail.com".
# edit /etc/nullmailer/adminaddr to contain the address you want mail to root to be routed to.
# edit /etc/nullmailer/remotes to contain the mail server to forward email to. 
}}}
<b>OR</b>
{{{
# exim4 instructions

sudo apt-get -y install mailutils
sudo dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config
}}}
Once you've done that and verified that it works, you might want to create a daily cronjob to execute /usr/bin/sostat and email you the output:
{{{
# /etc/cron.d/sostat
#
# crontab entry to run sostat and email its output

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
EMAIL=YourUsername@YourDomain.com

01 12    * * *   root    HOSTNAME=`hostname`; /usr/bin/sostat | mail -s "$HOSTNAME stats" $EMAIL
}}}

= How do I configure Bro to send emails? =
Edit /usr/local/etc/broctl.cfg and set the following:
{{{
MailTo = YourUsername@YourDomain.com
sendmail = /usr/sbin/sendmail
}}}
Then update and restart Bro:
{{{
sudo broctl install
sudo broctl restart
}}}

You should then start receiving hourly connection summary emails.  You may also want to receive emails for Bro notices.  To do that, uncomment the following line in /usr/local/share/bro/site/local.bro:
{{{
# redef Notice::policy += { [$action = Notice::ACTION_ALARM, $priority = 0] };
}}}
(Don't forget to update and restart Bro as shown above.)  If that's too much email, you might want to comment it out that line again and instead only email selected notices like this:
{{{
redef Notice::emailed_types += {
       HTTP::Incorrect_File_Type,
       HTTP::SQL_Injection_Victim,
       SSH::Interesting_Hostname_Login,
       HTTP::Malware_Hash_Registry_Match,
};
}}}
