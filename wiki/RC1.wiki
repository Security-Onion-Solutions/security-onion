#summary Security Onion 12.04 RC1

*NOTE!* We're no longer in Beta/RC.  Please see the [Installation Installation page].

= Introduction =

Security Onion 12.04 RC1 is now available and ready for testing!  Thanks to everybody who has helped get us this far!

= Warning! =
This is a Release Candidate, but there may still be rough edges.  If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces!

= RAM Minimum Requirements =
512MB - 1GB RAM for the core OS (512MB for Ubuntu Server with no GUI)<br>
+512MB RAM for the server components (apache, sguild, Snorby, ELSA web, etc.)<br>
+1GB RAM for EACH network interface that you choose to monitor <br>
+ >=512MB RAM if you choose to enable ELSA 

= Hardware Recommendations =
  * 64-bit<br>
  * Two or more NICs (one for management, one or more for sniffing), I've had good experience with Intel cards<br>
  * as much RAM as your server holds!<br>
  * as much Disk as your server holds!<br>

= Installation =
If this is your first time trying Security Onion 12.04, we recommend the pre-built Security Onion ISO image.  It's based on Xubuntu 12.04 64-bit and has all Security Onion packages already installed.

All of our Security Onion packages are in an Ubuntu Launchpad PPA.  So if you don't want to use our ISO image (perhaps you'd like a stripped down sensor based on Ubuntu Server with no GUI) and you have experience with Ubuntu, you can start with your preferred flavor of Ubuntu 12.04, add our PPA and packages, and be up and running in just a few minutes!

== Installing with the Security Onion ISO Image (based on Xubuntu 12.04 64-bit) ==
  * Click the following link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/security-onion/files/12.04/
  * Click the most recent ISO image to begin the download. Also download/record the MD5/SHA1 checksums for the ISO image. There is an accompanying .md5 file or you can use the MD5/SHA1 checksums that  Sourceforge displays when clicking the Information (view details) button to the right of the ISO image (it's a circle with an "i").  Once the ISO image download has completed, verify the checksum.
  * Boot the ISO image into the Live Desktop environment and then double-click the Install icon on the desktop.
  * Follow the prompts and reboot into your new installation.
  * Login using the username/password you specified during installation.
  * Verify that you have Internet connectivity.  If necessary, configure your [Proxy proxy settings].
  * IMPORTANT! Apply any available updates using the graphical package manager or from the command line:
{{{
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}}
  * Double-click the Setup icon.  The Setup wizard will walk you through configuring /etc/network/interfaces and will then reboot.
  * After rebooting, log back in and start the Setup wizard again.  It will detect that you have already configured /etc/network/interfaces and will walk you through the rest of the configuration.
  * Once you've completed the Setup wizard, use the Desktop icons to login to Sguil, Squert, Snorby, or ELSA.

== Installing with your preferred flavor of Ubuntu 12.04 ==
  * Please read these instructions CAREFULLY and follow them EXACTLY.  Commands have been formatted for easy copy/paste to avoid typos.
  * Ubuntu *12.04* is an LTS (Long Term Support) release and is fully tested/supported for Security Onion.  Ubuntu *12.10* is *NOT* an LTS release and is *NOT* tested/supported for Security Onion.
  * Download your desired flavor of Ubuntu *12.04*.  You should be able to use 32-bit or 64-bit, but 64-bit is highly recommended (assuming your hardware supports it):
   * Ubuntu Server (no GUI)- http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server
   * Ubuntu Desktop - http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop
   * Kubuntu - http://www.kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/download
   * Xubuntu - http://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/
   * Lubuntu - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/GetLubuntu
  * Verify the checksum of the downloaded ISO image.
  * Boot the ISO image.
  * Proceed through the Ubuntu installer.  If prompted to select additional packages, only choose openssh-server (specifically do NOT choose MySQL).  Our packages will automatically install any dependencies later.
  * Reboot into your new installation.
  * If you installed a GUI, login using the username/password you specified in the Ubuntu installer.  If you installed Ubuntu Server (no GUI), you'll want to SSH into your new installation from another machine (with an X server) using the -X option to enable X-Forwarding:
{{{
ssh -X username@ip.of.securityonion.server

# Once logged in, you may get a message concerning .Xauthority.  
# This file should be created automatically, but if it doesn't (occassionally this has happened on AWS instances), you can create it manually:
touch ~/.Xauthority
}}}
  * Verify that you have Internet connectivity.  If necessary, configure your proxy settings as described later on this page.
  * IMPORTANT! Apply any available Ubuntu updates (including new kernel packages) and REBOOT (this is required for the pf_ring DKMS module to build properly):
{{{
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo reboot
}}}
  * If you're running a VM, now would be a good time to snapshot it so you can revert later if you need to.
  * Log back in (over "ssh -X" if remote) and configure MySQL not to prompt for root password: 
{{{
echo "debconf debconf/frontend select noninteractive" | sudo debconf-set-selections  
}}}
  * Add our stable repo: 
{{{
sudo apt-get -y install python-software-properties
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:securityonion/stable
sudo apt-get update
}}}
  * Install securityonion-all (or one of our more targeted metapackages from the list below).  This could take 15 minutes or more depending on the speed of your CPU and Internet connection:
{{{
sudo apt-get -y install securityonion-all 
}}}
  * If you got any errors when installing the Security Onion packages, please see the DKMS/pf_ring known issue below.
  * Run the Setup wizard (if you get a zenity Gtk-WARNING, then you need to make sure you used "ssh -X" to enable X-Forwarding):
{{{
sudo sosetup
}}}
  * The Setup wizard will walk you through configuring /etc/network/interfaces and will then reboot.
  * After rebooting, log back in (over "ssh -X" if remote) and start the Setup wizard again.  It will detect that you have already configured /etc/network/interfaces and will walk your through the rest of the configuration.
  * Once you've completed the Setup wizard, open the Chromium web browser and go to https://localhost for links to Squert, Snorby, and ELSA.
  * To launch the Sguil client, find the icon in the Security Onion menu (Xubuntu/Lubuntu) or just type the following at a terminal:
{{{
sguil.tk
}}}

= Sample pcaps =
Security Onion includes some sample pcaps in /opt/samples/.  You can replay them using tcpreplay as follows (assuming eth1 is your sniffing interface):
{{{
sudo tcpreplay -i eth1 -M10 /opt/samples/*.pcap
}}}

= Tuning and Maintenance =  
For more information on tuning and maintenance, take a look at our [Installation] guide for the old 10.04 version.

= Metapackages =
The instructions above used the securityonion-all metapackage to install ALL of our individual packages (about 350MB).  We have some more focused metapackages that you can use for a more focused deployment:
  * securityonion-client (about 50MB)
  * securityonion-sensor (about 50MB)
  * securityonion-elsa and securityonion-elsa-extras (about 50MB)
  * securityonion-server (about 200MB)

= CapME =
Our Setup script automatically configures both Snorby and ELSA to be able to pivot to CapME for full transcripts.  The CapME page will prompt you for username/password and you will enter your normal Sguil/Squert/ELSA username/password.  You have the option of automatically authenticating, but be aware that this will send your username/password in the GET request, so it will be displayed in the browser bar in plaintext.

== Configuring Snorby to auto-authenticate to CapME ==
  * Click "Administration and General Settings".
  * Under OpenFPC, select "Packet capture auto-authenticate" and enter your *Sguil* username and password.
  * Click "Save Settings".

== Configuring ELSA to auto-authenticate to CapME ==
  * Click the ELSA menu and click Preferences.
  * Create a new Preference called "openfpc_username" and enter your *Sguil* username.
  * Create a new Preference called "openfpc_password" and enter your *Sguil* password.
  * Close the Preferences window and reload the ELSA page.

= Known Issues =

===DKMS unable to build pf_ring kernel module===
If you forgot to run the following command before installing our packages:
{{{
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo reboot
}}}
then you could get into a situation where DKMS is unable to build your pf_ring kernel module because you're not running the most recent kernel.  This will result in cascading errors in our package installation.  The good news is it looks like if you then run that command, it should sort everything out:
{{{
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo reboot
}}}
After the machine restarts, check to see if the pf_ring module got built and loaded correctly:
{{{
lsmod |grep pf_ring
}}}
If there is no output (the pf_ring module didn't get built/loaded), you can try reinstalling the pfring-module package:
{{{
sudo apt-get install --reinstall securityonion-pfring-module
}}}
If it still fails, start over with a fresh Ubuntu installation and follows the steps at the top of the page exactly.

===Kernel panics when running Suricata with multiple PF_RING threads===
Some users have reported kernel panics when running Suricata with multiple PF_RING threads.  If you experience this, try changing IDS_LB_PROCS in /etc/nsm/$SENSOR/sensor.conf to 1 (and restart Suricata) until we've discovered the root cause of this.

===Proxy configuration===
If you use a proxy on your network for outbound Internet connections, you may need to configure Ubuntu for your proxy to allow it to download updates.  Please see our [Proxy] page and make sure you set all 3 variables (http_proxy, https_proxy, and ftp_proxy).  If you still have issues downloading updates through your proxy, please see this note from Brian Sims:
"it doesn't look like add-apt-repository, as noted in the install instructions plays nice, by default, with http proxies.   With both the http_proxy environment variable configured as well as being in apt.conf (apt itself works, as does wget, etc), add-apt-respository eventually just fails with a cryptic "Error reading /securityonion/test/ubuntu: couldn't connect to host".    The repo is added to /etc/apt/sources.list.d, but the part that fails is the key retrieval.  Looks like a fairly common problem, solution seems to be to use apt-key afterwards, where you can specify a proxy as an argument on the command line, last argument is the SO keyid."
{{{
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --keyserver-options http-proxy="http://user:pass@foo.bar:3128" --recv-keys E1E6759023F386C7
}}}

===PRADS===
PRADS is a replacement for both PADS and SANCP.  Known issues with PRADS:<br>
https://github.com/gamelinux/prads/issues/19<br>

===netsniff-ng===
netsniff-ng currently runs as root.  The next version of netsniff-ng will support running as a non-root user.<br>
<br>
If your box was upgraded from Beta and you have problems with netsniff-ng starting, you may still have the old netsniff-ng package.  You can remove it by doing the following:
{{{
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo apt-get remove --purge netsniff-ng
}}}
Also be aware that netsniff-ng will fail on startup if it doesn't detect link on the NIC.
